# üåø RAG-Powered Wellness Assistant

This is a web application built with Streamlit that serves as a multi-functional wellness assistant. The application has two primary features:

1.  **Wellness Questionnaire:** A simple form that gathers information about a user's lifestyle, age, gender, and stress levels to calculate a wellness score. Based on this score, it provides a general supplement recommendation for Magnesium and L-Carnitine.
2.  **RAG-Powered Chatbot:** Users can upload one or more personal health documents (in PDF format). The application then uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to answer user questions based *only* on the content of the uploaded documents. If no documents are uploaded, it acts as a general wellness chatbot.



## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive UI:** A clean and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** A questionnaire that provides a score-based supplement suggestion.
-   **Secure Document Handling:** Uploaded PDFs are processed in memory and are not stored permanently.
-   **Contextual Chat:** The RAG implementation ensures that the chatbot's answers are grounded in the user-provided documents, reducing hallucinations.
-   **Dual-Mode Chat:** Functions as a document-specific assistant when files are provided, and a general wellness assistant otherwise.
